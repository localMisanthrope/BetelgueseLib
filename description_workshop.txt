BETELGEUSE LIB
(Bee-tuhl-joos)
(Or "Beetlejuice")

Betelgeuse is an experimental re-implementation of MoeLib that breaks reliance on components being instanced per-entity.

Betelgeuse rethinks the process of instantiation by creating template instances, with the spawned entities being fabricated from prefabs.

ECG: ENTITY-COMPONENT-GLOBAL
Betelgeuse splits components and globals, creating a "subscriber-based" system in its place.
Entities can subscribe to specialized Globals using individualized Components. Once subscribed, these Components are stored, iterated over, saved, and loaded automatically.
ComponentGlobals are not instanced per entity, and opt to save their subscriber dictionary, allowing components to persist past leaving the world.

TAGS
Betelgeuse also introduces entity tags, which enable Entities to subscribe to descriptive tags that can alter their functionality.

PREFABS
Betegeuse employs prefabs for each entity type, allowing you to spawn template instances to your own specifications.
Prefabs are loaded from the DataPath specified in the template instance. Once loaded, prefabs can be used anywhere from their registry.

TILE COMPONENTS
All tiles are able to have components which can affect their functionality.
Tile Components function similarly to an ECF, where data and logic are paired into one object.
Tile Components can save and load their own individual data, should the need arise.
Tile Components can be used to circumvent the need for multiple Tile Entities on one tile.

JSON SUPPORT
Like MoeLib, Betelgeuse supports and encourages the usage of Json files to achieve content loading.
All template instances and prefabs are read manually through these files, with various helper functions to give wider support.

VARIOUS HELPFUL FUNCTIONS
Betelgeuse offers a variety of helper functions and extensions; you can find a list on Betelgeuse's GitHub wiki.
