BETELGEUSE LIB
(Bee-tuhl-joos)
(Or "Beetlejuice")

Betelgeuse is an experimental re-implementation of MoeLib that breaks reliance on needing pre-made ModX classes with primary constructors for entities.

With Betelgeuse, concepts of components and data remain the same, however all entities are handled with a "container" of data structs.
Each struct pertains to a component, which gets enabled with the subsequent data.

All entities are instanced from JSON, with components being made to be versatile and all-encompassing.

Like MoeLib, Betelgeuse also implements automatic JSON deserialization and instantiation for ease of use.

ENTITIES AND COMPONENTS
Betelgeuse follows an "entity-component" styled architecture, meaning entites are containers for components which contain data.
Components and their subsequent "actors" act upon each component within the container and the data attached.

JSON INSTANTIATION
Betelgeuse allows modders to instantiate items from deserialized JSON files.
Documentation of best practices for implementation are on the GitHub wiki.
